<h1>CNIT-133M: Mobile Web w/HTML CSS & JS</h1>
<img src="me.jpg" alt="picture of Jonathan Hollander">
	<p>I'm a San Franciscan Native, and my goal is to become a Frontend Web Developer. I enjoy playing video games, meeting new people, traveling, teaching, trying new restaurants, spending time with friends and family, hiking, biking, and finding new buffets with friends in the Bay Area. </p>

	<p id="clear">I'm attending this class because I would like to be able to create websites for different sized devices such as mobile cell phones, tablets, large desktops, as well as newer devices that come to the market.  I have a basic understanding of media queries, the goal of responsive design, but I'm hoping this class will expand on that knowledge for future practice. I'm aware I will always have to continue to learn new concepts, new techniques, in order to keep up with today's fast pace technology, but I love learning new things and having the ability to continue learning. Ajax is something that I find very useful, and am extremely excited that it will be used in this class.</p>
